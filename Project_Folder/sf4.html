                Borges’ narrator tells us about a lottery in the country of Babylon (the namesake of the ancient Middle-Eastern region but, we assume, a distinct and fictional country) which began centuries ago. Back then, people would enter the lottery by paying a copper coin, in the hope of winning silver coins in return.
                
                
                But the lottery soon developed into something more, because it was only partially successful in its early form. To make it more appealing to human nature, people entering the lottery might either win a nice prize or incur a fine. Why would this make the lottery more appealing? Because people did not want to appear cowardly by failing to enter it (because they feared incurring a fine), so peer pressure led to more people paying to take part.
                
                In time, the mysterious Company which runs the lottery replaced the fine with imprisonment. Those who had bought one of the unlucky tickets would go to jail, simply for having the wrong ticket that had been drawn at random. Soon, other punishments were introduced.
                
                But the lower classes, who could not afford to pay to enter the lottery on a regular basis, demanded the right to be entered into it. The narrator states that the turning point was when a slave, without any money of his own, stole someone’s lottery ticket, which just so happened to be one of the unlucky tickets to be drawn, carrying the ‘prize’ of having one’s tongue burned.
                
                
                By chance, the law of the land also stated that having one’s tongue burned was the punishment for stealing a lottery ticket. The people of Babylon saw this as a sign that the lottery wasn’t as random as it appeared to be, and they won their right to be automatically entered into the lottery.
                
                The Company which ran the lottery became, in a sense, the state, because it had power over every single citizen, as everyone was a participant in its lottery. The extremes between nice prizes and nasty surprises, as it were, became more pronounced: at one end, a lucky winner might be promoted to a high office in Babylon, while at the other end, they might be killed.
                
                However, this led more people to believe that the outcomes were merely random, and not necessarily tied to the lottery. Someone might die and it be a coincidence that they had drawn an ‘unlucky’ ticket bearing that fate. So the Company launched a propaganda campaign to convince the population that they, the Company, controlled everything.
                
                People started to believe it was so, and that even random chance was somehow controlled by the Company. And the Company, in turn, realised that the people had given them permission to take over control of every aspect of daily life. The number of drawings in the lottery, which determined every outcome of every citizen in Babylon, became ‘infinite’.
                
                
                What happens, then, is that the lottery becomes the same as ‘life’: the lottery supposedly determines everything, even the ‘errors’ and discrepancies found in books (even between copies of the same book). Creating and spreading falsehoods is actively encouraged.
                
                Indeed, it even becomes possible that the Company no longer exists and that everything that has happened since its dissolution is just genuine random chance. By contrast, it is possible that the Company is more powerful than ever and controls everything.
